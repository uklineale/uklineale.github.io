This is nothing new, but topic sentences are “important” or something. Viewing the present with a lens from the past is useful, but apparently hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Godel, Escher, Bach has taught me something, it’s that thinking outside of the current system requires some oomph. If living and watching has taught me something, it’s that adding oomph isn’t in a lot of people’s strengths. Maybe they’d add a little extra effort, but it’d pale in comparison to the meta-task at hand. This blog is just one attempt at showing that most learning isn’t that bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SpeakerRyan/status/759845524132524032&quot;&gt;Paul Ryan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/govpencein/status/674249808610066433?lang=en&quot;&gt;Mike Pence&lt;/a&gt; both opposed any harsh immigration bans before the presidential election, though now they are fairly quiet about it. After Stalin’s death, Nikita Kruschev publicly denounced Stalin to show he was breaking from the old regime. As Kruschev listed the tortures and murders of the old, some bold soul yelled, “Well, why didn’t you get rid of him?” Kruschev barked, “Who said that?” but only silence replied. Kruschev asked again, “Who said that?” After another bout of silence, he said “Well, now you understand why we didn’t do anything.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">History is a template for the future, since all current moments are derivations of the past.

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
