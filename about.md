Mental health, musings, and the apparent realm of [magic][interview].

I don't want to spend much time writing. I prefer doing. So I do and keep things terse. Rambling pains me, as it's a loss of time. I consider myself a man wounded fatally, and act as such. This is the last life I get, and I better use it. However, I've had so much help from articles online I would consider it unfair not to at least try and pay it forward.
