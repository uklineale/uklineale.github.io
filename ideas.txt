The Infinite Churn
- 
- A warrior is someone who knows love through strength in its many forms.
- If you don't use you strength to give love to the world, you are not fighting the right battle.
- If you are not training in earnest to increase your strength, you do not know what a fight looks like.
- The master appears no different from the novice until you see their reactions. Mastery is as mundane as instinct.
- Headspace talks/ Zen in Archery: observer, arrow, and observed are one moment
- Primordial mirror/goodness/still pool/the five sheaths
- Windhorse / Firebending: summoning strength from your internal fire
- Headspace monism / Shambala archer's clarity: view a moment untainted

	- Weed: THC helps with migraines, but burns your short term memory. Use sparingly.
		CBD helps with pain/inflammation
	- Vestibular PT: lifesaver, warded off nausea and helped my vision
	- Light-moderate cardio up to tolerance: DO NOT OVERDO flare-ups
	- Spinal manipulation: maybe? not for me.
	- Accupuncture: the emperor never lost his groove
	- Meditation: attention span > short term memory > long term memory
		Plus being okay with the trauma of having the capability of an old man
	- Doctor's don't know much about it, if it hurts don't do it, if it's complicated try it

	- Practice telling people firmly what you can and can't do or withstand.
	- Carry earplugs, get sunglasses.
	- Vitamins, because why not
	- Check hormone levels
- Little known symptoms:

	- fatigue/weakness (I couldn't walk)
	- trouble thinking which leads to trouble speaking, moving, seeing (Moravec's paradox)
- shitty instances of people need to be reduced, or let go
- Why not clean up your life. If you can level up with half a brain, when can't you level up? :)
