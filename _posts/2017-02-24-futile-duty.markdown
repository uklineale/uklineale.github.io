After [smiling like a ghost][smiling], feeling real and alive shoots you full of a cold hope. Hope fills your steps with a purpose. Determination is cold, and acts patiently. Transient purposes leave you empty by the wayside, but a purpose that lasts for lifetimes is hard not to pursue. You literally can't stop thinking, noticing, or talking about this personal mission. It doesn't become you, but it consumes you. The fringes of your identity dim down, and every morning this purpose cuts through your wakeful fog.

Unfortunately, sometimes your mission is futile, but if you've donned the mentality of an ox you'll keep plodding along. If you want to rest easy, make your peace with not doing the most good possible. The journey of a thousand steps just needs you to keep trudging.
