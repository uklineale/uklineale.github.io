Cultivating self-mastery is the most challenging, but most rewarding task of this life. Along the path, I've been blessed to discover several traits that develop into boons. I am grateful for the opprotunity to better myself as often as I choose, and know I have a lot to work on. With further practice I'm sure I will discover more. 

I have found:

Mercy leads to trust and courage. 

Frugality allows me to be generous.

Humility makes me the best leader I can be.

Service makes me happy.

Salvation lies in love alone.

Being present cures my fear of the passage of time and death.

Forgiveness cures my righteous (and too often unrighteous) anger.

Acceptance cures me of regret.

Gratitude cures me of cynicism. 

We have one life, so we must invest appropriately. To cultivate such invaluable treasures is a form of wealth even the rich envy. Self-knowledge is wealth. Self-change is divine.
