George Floyd was a good father, gentle giant, and giving soul who strove to be a better man. He was robbed of the chance for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. What happens when the unalienable get taken away from us?

The current events have driven a nail into my thick skull. Someone who does not speak up is as bad as someone who doesn't know what to say. Intentions are the seed, practice, knowledge, and insight are the fruit, and every sentient being is a guest at your feasts. A seed looks the same as a patch of dirt until the sprout touches daylight.

Been into haikus lately because of my latest rehab.

So identities  
To not be trapped in one is  
Free at last, free at-
