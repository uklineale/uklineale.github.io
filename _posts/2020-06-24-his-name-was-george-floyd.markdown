The current events have driven a nail into my thick skull. Someone who does not speak up is as bad as someone who doesn't know what to say. Intentions are the seed, practice and insight the fruit, and every sentient being the guests of your feasts. A seed looks the same as a patch of dirt until the sprout touches daylight.

Been into haikus lately.

So identities  
To not be trapped in one is  
Free at last, free at-
