The current events have driven a nail into my thick skull. Someone who does not speak up is as bad as someone who doesn't know what to say. Intentions are the seed, practice, knowledge, and insight are the fruit, and every sentient being is a guest at your feasts. A seed looks the same as a patch of dirt until the sprout touches daylight.

Been into haikus lately. Because of my latest rehab. ![Zer0, Borderlands robotic, zen-like, bloodthirsty executioner who only speaks in haiku.]

So identities  
To not be trapped in one is  
Free at last, free at-  

We will rise for our
Brothers taken too damn soon
So none need to kneel
