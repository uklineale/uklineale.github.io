**IF YOU HAVE PTSD: Be warned. I describe the struggles, the strange tics, the feeling like a husk of a person, and the alienation I felt and feel. I also discuss solutions and acceptance, but *if you do not feel comfortable confronting it, my descriptions below may trigger something.* If you need help dealing with it, I cannot stress enough though that *you are not alone*. Reach out to someone you trust or someone you can relate to. Get professional help if that's more your style. Every person is different, so every solution needs to be too.**

Brace yourself, this post will be longer than you, me, and anyone in between could anticipate. It will be long, rambling, and make me cry several times. I feel no shame, because lives are no small matter. I feel no shame because I draw my strength from my struggles. I feel no shame because no one is whole, everyone is broken, and there is nothing wrong with it.

If other posts haven't made it clear, I think about death a lot. It's a great motivator to [smile][smile] with each breath. Dividing the people into the self and others is a natural, often unconscious distinction. This post deals with the others part of that distinction. If you haven't discerned it, this article is about killing others. No points for guessing what the next article will be about :)

People are connected in all sorts of ways, and killing just one rips a whole void in the web of personal strifes, mundane boredoms, and peals of laughter that the timeline once had. It rips a conscious soul out of the [fabric of our universe] and leaves you staring at the stillness left behind. It's when all armchair philosophies fall by the wayside. All that's left is the boy convulsing on the street. All that's left is the full understanding of the word mercy. All that's left is knowing that you won't be the same.

I did martial arts for a little less than a third of my life. To a certain extent, my reactions are hard-wired. It's like a dark, unthinking beast who only knows the soft spots of human anatomy. Autonomy is closest to sanity, and this beast doesn't care for my free will. 

I started working for Jimmy Johns as a bike courier in the spring semester of 2015. My manager and I were standing around in the shop when it started to snow. Being a rare occurrence in North Carolina, my manager pointed it out. As we looked outside, we saw a kid hop on my rusty mountain bike and take off with it. This is where instinct took over and my autonomy was left in the store. I dashed out, ran him down, and flung the thief into some patio furniture. As he got up in a daze, we traded some hands. During this time, I got a better scope of the guy. His punches were weak, and he was awfully skinny. I got behind him and choked him until he went limp. The sound of his throat trying to breathe is something I wish I could forget. My autonomy gave a little spark and I let the thief fall to the ground. It clicked as I watched his body crumple that he wasn't older than eighteen.

I heard a yell and saw a kid running towards me, assumedly the thief's partner. The beast grinned its wolfish grin. The boy's chin was up. I threw a punch aimed for his adam's apple. In the moments before it connected, I felt the malice of the beast release me. My body released all desire to hurt these kids. It was a permanent release, the most powerful emotion I've ever felt. I understood mercy and love in that instant. I pulled the punch with all that I could. 

Unfortunately for both of us, the boy ran into my limp fist with his adams apple. He fell backwards and spasmed for a bit. I watched in horror. This kid was stealing a crappy bike I got for free, and he nearly lost his life doing it. I then realized I wished the first thief was faster on my bike. I wish they were smoother with their operation. I wish they didn't feel the pressure to steal. I wish I could talk to these kids. I wish I could show them how to run an op smoother, and maybe, just fucking maybe, talk them out of doing it at all. It might have been a gang initiation. Maybe they needed the money, which is funny because that bike was probably worth $25. But these are wishes and maybes, neither of which happened.

The first boy had gotten up behind me and I guess shaken off the haze of passing out. The second boy was started to struggle to his feet. I felt a punch in the kidney and a shove. A coworker, a loving single mother, came out and shouted with the voice of a woman who has stopped a number of fights. The tension was broken. As I stumbled from the shove, I saw the first boy help the second to his feet and take off running into a neighborhood. I didn't give chase. This all took place in the span of five or so minutes, and some passerbys were noticing. A man in a black sedan asked me if I was okay and which way the boys head off. He zoomed away chasing these kids as a woman came by and picked up my glasses near the patio furniture.

For the next year, I was skittish. People touching me could make me freak out and leap away. I couldn't relate to people for a long time. Anytime someone mentioned killing others lightly, I leapt to defend the sanctity of life. I stopped talking to people and withdrew, which is was a terrible mistake. I still have nightmares, but they don't have the emotional engulfment they used to. I still have breakdowns where my heart starts racing and my vision and hearing get blocked out and I'm taken back to watching that kid struggle for air. When triggered, I react as if it's life or death when it's really just breakfast. Certain plastics make a crunching noise that reminds me of the sound of a boy being choked.

I was drenched in self-loathing for a while. I knew that the beast was inside of me, and it was set to a hair trigger now. I would be forced to watch myself commit atrocity due to hours of boyhood dedication to throwing a perfect cross. Even before the fight, I didn't really feel much connection with people except when I sparred. Reading someone's moves before they did was the closest thing to connection I knew. If the only way I could connect was through violence, I thought I must be a monster. Because the beast could take over and send me into a calm, violent haze, I thought I must be a monster. During my depression, I wanted to end my life. I wouldn't have minded ending other's lives either if it came to it. I held these beliefs too strongly, so I thought I must be a monster. It's not rational, but mental health isn't either.

Four months after the event, I got invited to spar with a friend learning to box. I was very hesitant, but I went anyways. I had a good time, and enjoyed coaching. Martial arts was where I grew up, and where I found my first semblances of male role models. I loved it, but I hated its purpose. Until recently, I couldn't even consider going back to the mat. I had shunned a whole part of me, making me feel like a husk of a man. Until I can befriend my beast, I know I won't be anywhere close to complete. 

Almost two years later (now), I don't feel hesitant to do martial arts anymore. I'm currently looking for a good judo school. 

Thankfully, I did not kill. The meaning of mercy has been seared into my steps, my hesitations, my skittishness, my breakdowns in a secluded stairwell, my revulsion to violence. The path of empathy is clear, and I choose to hobble down it with what husk of myself remains. I write about my glance over the abyss into the realm of the beast because I know that some people are caged by their beast. Some people have fallen into the abyss. In a world of hypermasculinity, men are told they should kill without flinching. They should let their beast run free and wreck shit, fuck girls, and yell out their accomplishments. I sincerely say, fuck that. Women are wise, and hard materials are brittle.

Sometimes, you need a soft touch. If you are still caged by your beast, don't try and force yourself to be better. Take it easy. Counter your beast with humanity and make it your pet, not your owner, not your slave. Recently, I made a [great friend][cory] who also struggled with PTSD. Talking out our experiences made breakthroughs I couldn't imagine. If you want to reach out to me, my email is somewhere on this blog. Be kind to yourself, and stay strong. It does get better, and you're not alone.
