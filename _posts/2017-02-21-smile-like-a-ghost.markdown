Watch the day go by. Really watch it.

Nod to the homeless vet who only acts crazy to keep away trouble. Watch that family chastise their little girl until she falls and the scorn turns to sympathy. Smile at the elderly couple holding hands because they need each other to balance. Empathize with (and laugh inwardly at) the yuppie who's frustrated at spilling a drop of marinara on his button down.

Now imagine yourself invisible, inaudible, and intangible: a ghost for all practical purposes. All the love and life you've ever had are constrained only to you. You can't impact a single thing or talk to a single person. The wind blows through you. How do each of the lives above change?

Life goes on without us. Most would barely notice your absence.

Thankfully, you're still alive and corporeal! Make sure people notice your presence, and make damn sure they'll miss it.
