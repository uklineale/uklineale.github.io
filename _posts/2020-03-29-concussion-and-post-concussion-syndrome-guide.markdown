I've had six notable concussions in my life usually about a year apart. My fifth one almost killed me. While unconscious, I had a vision of a stained glass Buddha telling me I was near death. My sixth can make me unable to walk, talk, or think. Concussions are no joke. The media will often show someone getting knocked out for an hour as no big deal, but being unconscious for more than a few minutes is a sign of significant brain damage. Not even the best football players, special forces operators, or martial artists can withstand years of trauma. These types of trauma are considered mild Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI). Anyone who drives a car is at risk for severe, life-altering moderate or severe TBI. As I found out during my ongoing years of recovery from Post Concussion Syndrome, there is a lot we don't know about concussions. Here's what I've found out over my experiences with three physical therapists, four neurologists, a chiropractor, an accupuncturist, and much more of the medical system than I'd prefer.

*AT YOUR INURY'S PACE NOT YOUR OWN: Sleep as much as you need, cardio exercise to a constantly increasing threshold, and retrain your eyes for screens.*

A couple rules of thumb before we dive into the more rigorous science that I'm _barely_ qualified for. 
- Sleep.
- Do aerobic exercise that doesn't trigger your symptoms.
- Limit screen time.
- Don't drink alcohol, and lay off the weed. CBD can help alleviate pain, anxiety, and/or emotional stability. NSAIDs as needed for migraine relief. 
- Keep doing what you're able to that's part of your normal routine. 
- Slowly practice what you aren't able to do. Build back to normal at your body's pace *not your usual pace*. This can be incredibly slow after a significant injury. Don't consider pushing yourself, because it will not help you heal faster. 
- When in doubt about the amount of effort to put into rehab, err on the side of too little rather than too much. 
- Take breaks during cognitive tasks like school or work. 
- Figure out what triggers your symptoms, especially headaches. Avoid these triggers at first. Then slowly expose yourself to some of them if your normal life has these triggers. "Headaches are like your brain screaming at you", said my last PT who was [my best PT in RTP](https://drayer.urpt.com/locations/raleigh/). Dr. Glenn at [Raleigh Neurology](http://www.raleighneurology.com/) is the best concussion rehab and diagnosis I've ever been to.

### General Care
None of this advice is specific to concussion/PCS rehab, but it sets a good foundation for healing. Eat a healthy, balanced diet. 

### Vision is Expensive
Imagine a budget where the currency is chunks of work done by bodily functions. Vision is exteremely cognitively expensive, but healing is pretty expensive too. You have to balance this budget to keep healing going smoothly. Our eyes have been an incredible boon to our species' continued survival. They take in incredible amounts of info quickly enough during a single sweep of a room. Imagine the incredibly complex problems in [computer vison](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-is-computer-vision/). Now imagine how sophisticated that could get over millions of years. You may have to repair that part of your brain while it's still functioning, so any slight strain on eyes can slow down the all-hands-on-deck healing scenario. Limit screen time because it is hard on our eyes. Make sure your contacts or glasses prescriptions are up to date. Go to an [*opthalmologist* _not your corner store optometrist_](https://www.allaboutvision.com/eye-doctor/choose.htm) to get checked.

### Medications and Supplements
Don't drink, as the symptoms of being drunk are fairly similar to those of a concussion. Although THC can help with migraines, lay off the weed as it can shorten your already damaged memory and attention span. CBD can help alleviate pain, anxiety, and/or emotional stability. Take NSAIDs as needed for migraine relief. [Higher quality](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LTHMG4A/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) fish oil supplements helped my cognitive abilities, taking about a month to feel the difference.

My third neurologist Dr. Glenn at Raleigh Neurology prescribed me amitriptyline, atomoxetine, and proprananol. Amitriptyline helped prevent migraines, but it took about 4 months of doctor's consulations to find the right dosage for me. Now it largely prevents chronic migraines, but it doesn't help migraines from doing things I know trigger my symptoms. For treatment of acute migraines, an NSAID like ibuprofen helps.

Atomoxetine (Straterra) helps you focus, similar to Ritalin or Adderall. Atomoxetine is a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Because it works on norepinephrine rather than dopamine the effects can take up to a month to show up, but it's not nearly as addictive as Ritalin or Adderall. Due to Ritalin or Adderall's effect on dopamine, they can be highly adictive, but very quick to take effect.

Emotional instability

Exercise
