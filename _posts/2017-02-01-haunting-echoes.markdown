History is a template for the future, since all current moments are derivations of the past. This is nothing new, but topic sentences are "important" or something. Viewing the present with a lens from the past is useful, but apparently hard.

If Godel, Escher, Bach has taught me something, it's that thinking outside of the current system requires some oomph. If living and watching has taught me something, it's that adding oomph isn't in a lot of people's strengths. Maybe they'd add a little extra effort, but it'd pale in comparison to the meta-task at hand. This blog is just one attempt at showing that most learning isn't that bad. 

[Paul Ryan][pr-tweet] and [Mike Pence][mp-tweet] both opposed any harsh immigration bans before the presidential election, though now they are fairly quiet about it. After Stalin's death, Nikita Kruschev publicly denounced Stalin to show he was breaking from the old regime. As Kruschev listed the tortures and murders of the old, some bold soul yelled, "Well, why didn't you get rid of him?" Kruschev barked, "Who said that?" but only silence replied. Kruschev asked again, "Who said that?" After another bout of silence, he said "Well, now you understand why we didn't do anything."
