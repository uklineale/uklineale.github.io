There are many cruel jokes the universe can play. There's the joke of being born in a country of less emotional worth to a powerful nation's zeitgeist. Collateral damage gets shrugs, but wounded American soldiers get pure grief. Nothing against our brave countrymen, just we should grieve for innocents equally as much as our own warfighters. I'm interested in hearing honest comments, stories, and criticisms by soldiers. Shoot me an email if you want.

I've thought a lot about being in the military, and a lot of it was spurred by depression. I told my mom when I first started noticing how bad it was getting, but I couldn't convey my emotions because I spoke broken Bengali and she spoke broken English. When she glimpsed what I meant, she just said "No, [son]". Her English wasn't the only thing broken that night, [heyooo][]! The rest of the family wasn't much help either. I didn't want to live, so I wanted to die doing the things I thought fun at the time: scuba diving, martial arts, staying in shape, parachuting, camping, shooting, and -oh right, dying. A nifty military job was all the rage according to most of the shows I'd watched, comments at parties I'd heard, and friends/role models I trained with. I heard about Marines OCS through college friends, but got rejected at MEPS. They told me my application would be flagged for three years, but only with the Marines/Navy. Then, I heard about Airforce PJs. The mission was charming, in that it involved jumping into brutal situations and risking your life to save another, while maybe taking a few on your way. If I can't enjoy living, at least the other person will. The allure of being among incredibly competent peers was also a huge draw, but like most teenagers (and people, really), I only respected competence in the things I cared about. 

Depression is one of the crueler jokes. The color goes from the light, the quiet, bright tinge of life fades from your view for a period of time determined in a genetic lottery no one asked for. Some people just "deal with it", but those some are monks of the highest caliber or people who struggled and suck at vocalizing it, empathizing with it, and "dealing with it". The rest of us have to work for our happiness. Don't worry, this is work you're proud of doing, and it's makes and easy feedback loop possible. Learning to ride the wave of habits is key, but actively trying sometimes makes failure. Not trying to try is the finicky sweetspot of the wave (I don't surf, but my [friend][cory] speaks highly of it).
