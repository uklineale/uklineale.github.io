I've thought a lot about being in the military, and a lot of it was spurred by depression. I told my mom when I first started noticing how bad it was getting, but I couldn't convey my emotions because I spoke broken Bengali and she spoke broken English. When she glimpsed what I meant, she just said "No, [son]". Her English wasn't the only thing broken that night, [heyooo][heyo]! The rest of the family wasn't much help either. My dad just got angry, and picked a lot of fights with me (I did the same). My brother tried making the old jokes, but I needed someone to stand up for my right to exist. No one really did for a while. I didn't want to live, so I wanted to die doing the things I thought fun at the time: scuba diving, martial arts, staying in shape, parachuting, being among peers, respect, camping, shooting, and -oh right, dying. A nifty military job was all the rage according to most of the shows I'd watched, comments at parties I'd heard, and friends/role models I trained with. I heard about Marines OCS through college friends, but got rejected at MEPS. They told me my application would be flagged for three years, but only with the Marines/Navy. Then, I heard about Airforce PJs. The mission was charming, in that it involved jumping into brutal situations and risking your life to save another, while maybe taking a few on your way. If I can't enjoy living, at least the other person will.

There are many cruel jokes the universe can play. There's the joke of being born in a country of less emotional worth to a powerful nation's zeitgeist. Collateral damage gets shrugs, but wounded American soldiers get pure grief. Nothing against our brave countrymen, just we should grieve for innocents equally as much as our own warfighters. I'm interested in hearing honest comments, stories, and criticisms by soldiers. Shoot me an email if you want.

Depression is one of the crueler jokes. The color goes from the light, the quiet, bright tinge of life fades from your view for a period of time determined in a genetic lottery no one asked for. People will blame you, asking if you tried stopping. They'll say it's in your head and you're being a stick in the mud. It is a curse if there's ever been one, and no small part of that curse comes from the perception of mental health problems. Some people just "deal with it", but those some are monks of the highest caliber or people who struggled and suck at vocalizing it, empathizing with it, and legitimately "dealing with it".

For those of you who need to find normality in your thoughts, suicidal depression is like wanting to scratch your junk in public. You fight the urge, but eventually you stop giving a fuck and do the deed. It lets you keep compiling skills to keep you from scratching, and eventually master the skills. You will still struggle with deression though, even with all the skills in the world. 

It's emptiness all the way down, and depression is the guide to realizing that. It gives you a chance to grapple with the void and be okay you'll lose. It is wonderful training to understand that all eternities for all beings end in death. It's a rewarding life experience to think about how you won't exist and to whisper to yourself , "Me too, eh? Oh, huh.". It's wonderful training to run head on into emptiness and anxiety It's wonderful training to understand that no one is ever done growing or suffering.
