For almost the past two years, I've been struggling with [Post Concussive Syndrome][pcs] (PCS). Known as the invisible injury due to the physical form looking fine, it's a poorly understood ailment where concussion symptoms last for months to years. Some victims never fully recover. PCS is radically different from person to person, and the array of possible specialists you need is daunting. This series of articles is meant to act as a beacon of hope for fellow PCS patients. The series also doubles to remind myself of the lessons I learned since a healthy mind is so quick to forget the wealth gained from injury. I've been wanting to move to Seattle and start my dream job of being a penetration tester for the [NCC Group][ncc] (formerly Matasano). They're reknowned as top-shelf when it comes to cryptography. Crypto knowledge will come in handy for future endeavors, but the winds of fate have some odd, frustrating, yet enlightening paths charted out for me to get there.

I got my latest concussion doing judo. We were practicing falls, and I fell flat on my back without turtling. Only saw a little flash, but I realized I hadn't felt that since boxing. I went home glad to be back on the mat. I went to a meditation retreat the next day, where a friend convinced me to see a doctor. The first symptoms were confusion, trouble focussing, and a little bit of head fog. These started about two days after the incident and worsened each day. Two weeks after the injury I saw [Dr. Kristen Clarey][] at [Carolina Family Medicine][]. I would've just gone to a brothel if I'd known how much she'd jerk me around. Her first diagnosis was a concussion, but the IMPACT test (a cognitive assesment) was only slightly below regular brains. A large component of the assessment was a subjective statement of how bad each symptom is today. I realized many appointments after I was underestimating these symptoms. She gave me some neck stretches to do and said to come back in a month if I wasn't better. The stretches helped, but more symptoms were coming on. I started getting headaches, dizziness, and nausea. I was mixing up words, and I felt slower in conversations. I went back to Dr. Clarey. When I got there, she was surprised to see me. This would be a recurring theme. I did another IMPACT test with similar results, and we checked the same things. This time she assigned me neck strengthening exercises. Within days, I ecstatically reached a new plateau. I kept up with the stretching and strengthening for two months, but still felt slow, foggy, and unfocused. My boss at the time wasn't very understanding of my condition and gave me a lot of flak for being slow and forgetting things. It didn't help I was suggesting our lack of devops and specialization was an insane way to work. Around this time I got into a funk and smoked a lot of weed to cope with the headaches. The symptoms worsened. Hard workouts I was used to would trigger my symptoms, and my body lost fifteen pounds of muscle. The costs of a childhood of fighting were starting to sink in.

I'll continue the medical journey in future articles, but for now I want to focus on how people react to hearing about the invisible injury. The responses I got from people revealed how they handled hardship. Some reactions were disbelief and laughing about it, ignoring it, understanding and eager to help (the vast majority of people), and being overly-helpful without understanding. It took me too long to realize the guys who didn't believe me and kept pressuring me to drink weren't my friends. That was a failure in my judgement. It became all too clear when one of them asked me if I thought football players crying from their brain damage was funny. I imagine they think the rise in [special forces suicides][socom] is hilarious. Ignoring it was a polite reaction by a lot of people. It's the mentality of "I'm good so you must be good too". Not the worst, but be prepared to give these people a brief summary and move on. They can often be bright points in your day after moving on in the conversation. The majority of people are eager to understand and help in whatever way feasible since most people are at least halfway decent. That kernel of decency can go too far though. If someone I haven't informed sees me wretching in a trashcan or struggling to walk, they'll be so eager to help and throw suggestions my way. During a fire drill where I overexerted myself and went blind temporarily, everyone was eager to help but thought I passed out from heatstroke. I got three ice packs that afternoon. It's a funny that when I need to verbalize my struggles the most is when I have trouble verbalizing anything. A manager who knows my condition helped ward off the well-intentioned assistants. Since that day, I've gotten a group of people informed on my various failure states who will help keep bystanders at bay.

If I could start again from the initial concussion, the biggest thing I'd change is not getting a second opinion sooner. Doctors aren't all equal, and just because someone's specialty is concussions doesn't mean they're able to help you. The medical industry is a labyrinth. I also would've scheduled more regular appointments with my doctor. She may have said come back in a month, but I should've aggressively gone every two weeks. Dr. Clarey's weakness was not firmly giving me a comprehensive recovery suite. Each new technique was learned after months of stagnating. The fault is both mine and hers. She did the same tests and gave me new exercises each time. I didn't go regularly and was underestimating my symptoms. I also messed up when I first got concussed by not taking any breaks soon after the incident. Thanksgiving was about three months after the injury, and the week long break healed me so much. 

Some of the funner hurdles of PCS are personality changes. I've been more impulsive for a while. I have more intrusive thoughts that just don't seem like me. I understand how easy it is to impulsively buy things. I'll start projects (including this one) in a frenzy. I've gotten anxiety attacks for the first time in my life. There may be too many cars when I'm driving, or the wind will shift when I'm on my right foot. I can empathize with freaking the fuck out over nothing. It's not great, but I'm actually grateful and glad I get to play the game with all these qualities. I can understand a wider slice of human experiences. Not everyone gets challenges to overcome in their life. These are mine, and I'm going to convert them into lessons that only death can take from me.
