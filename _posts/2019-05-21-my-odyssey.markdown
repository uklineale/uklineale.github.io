For almost the past two years, I've been struggling with [Post Concussive Syndrome][pcs] (PCS). It's a poorly understood ailment where concussion symptoms last for months to years. Some victims never fully recover. PCS is radically different from person to person, and the array of possible specialists you need is daunting. This series of articles is meant to act as a beacon of hope for fellow PCS patients. The series also doubles to remind myself of the lessons I learned since a healthy mind is so quick to forget the wealth gained from injury. I've been wanting to move to Seattle and start my dream job of being a penetration tester for the [NCC Group][ncc] (formerly Matasano). They're reknowned as top-shelf when it comes to cryptography. Crypto knowledge will come in handy for future endeavors, but the winds of fate have some odd, frustrating, yet enlightening paths charted out for me to get there.

I got my latest concussion doing judo. We were practicing falls, and I fell flat on my back without turtling. Only saw a little flash, but I realized I hadn't felt that since boxing. I went home glad to be back on the mat. I went to a meditation retreat the next day, where a friend convinced me to see a doctor. The first symptoms were confusion, trouble focussing, and a little bit of head fog. These started about two days after the incident and worsened each day. Two weeks after the injury I saw [Dr. Kristen Clarey][] at [Carolina Family Medicine][]. I would've just gone to a brothel if I'd known how much she'd jerk me around. Her first diagnosis was a concussion, but the IMPACT test (a cognitive assesment) was only slightly below regular brains. A large component of the assessment was a subjective statement of how bad each symptom is today. I realized too late I was underestimating these symptoms. She gave me some neck stretches to do and said to come back in a month if I wasn't better. The stretches helped, but more symptoms were coming on. I started getting headaches, dizziness, and nausea. I was mixing up words, and I felt slower in conversations. I went back to Dr. Clarey. 

When I got there, she was surprised to see me. This would be a recurring theme. I did another IMPACT test with similar results, and we checked the same things. This time she assigned me neck strengthening exercises. Within days, I ecstatically reached a new plateau. I kept up with the stretching and strengthening for two months, but still felt slow, foggy, and unfocused. My boss at the time wasn't very understanding of my condition and gave me a lot of flak for being slow and forgetting things. It didn't help I was suggesting our lack of devops and specialization was an insane way to work. Around this time I got into a funk and smoked a lot of weed to cope with the headaches. The symptoms got worse, and the hard workouts I was used to would trigger my symptoms. The costs of a childhood of fighting were starting to sink in.

If I could start from the last judo class to now again, the biggest thing I'd change is not getting a second opinion sooner. Doctors aren't all equal, and just because someone's specialty is concussions doesn't mean they're able to help you. I also would've scheduled more regular appointments with my doctor. She may have said come back in a month, but I should've aggressively gone every two weeks. Dr. Clarey's weakness was not firmly giving me a comprehensive recovery suite. Each new technique was learned after months of stagnating. The fault is both mine and hers. She did the same tests and gave me new exercises each time. I didn't go regularly and was underestimating my symptoms.

Some of the funner hurdles of PCS are personality changes. I've been more impulsive for a while. I have more intrusive thoughts that just don't seem like me. I understand how easy it is to impulsively buy things. I'll start projects (including this one) in a frenzy. I've gotten anxiety attacks for the first time in my life. There may be too many cars when I'm driving, or the wind will shift when I'm on my right foot. I can empathize with freaking the fuck out over nothing. It's not great, but I'm actually grateful and glad I get to play the game with all these qualities. I can understand a wider slice of human experiences. Not everyone gets challenges to overcome in their life. These are mine, and I'm going to convert them into lessons that only death can take from me.
