There's a lot of bullshit about meditation. There's a lot of fluff about its goals. Mindfulness meditation strengthens seeing the mind. Insight meditation shifts your view. Trust your experience, but keep refining your view. 

For my mind, there were disorders, brought about by genetics and brain damage. The mind is a projector of its expectations. I found depression to be seeing the future of the world, and assuming it's a bleak one. Anxiety was my brain accidentally mixing up my worries and insecurities into concoctions of the future. 

The mind sees a duality of experience consisting of expectations and dissatisfaction. One can't call the expectations separate from dissatisfaction, they rise together. What happens when part of that co-existence doesn't arise? 

With no future comes a free present. So much is possible when free. This is why we train.
