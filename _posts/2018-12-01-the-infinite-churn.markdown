Recent improvements in my health have given me the freedom to screw my head on straight. I've been dealing with Post Concussion Syndrome for about a year and four months now, and it's just now starting to clear. Cardio, meditation, breaks and work, and prioritizing sleep have been vital in my recent recovery. I can't thank [Dr. Joel C Morgenlander][], an incredible neurologist at Duke Medicine I am absolutely thankful for the friends and family that helped me maintain my sanity while being half a man with a shattered identity. I know I'm a man now. I am very very grateful to have matured before I got more entrenched in my roles. Now my head's on properly, I can set my roles. I can judge which to be. My hand isn't fated just because combat is fun, quick puzzle with stakes I don't care about. It's now just a part of me I know how to release productively. It vents as a furious drive to kick the fucking knees in of whatever I think needs destroying. I'm slowly getting back to my "old" self, although it's much like coming back from vacation and remembering the things that need fixing. Nobody can step into the same house twice. It's been a while since I've posted, and I think it's time to start again, especially since my memory ain't shit anymore. I found some knees that need kicking.
