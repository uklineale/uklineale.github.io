Trying to harmonize my want (some say need) to connect with my want to dive into the security mindset, I took a trip with the gang down to Harris Teeter while they picked up fried chicken and ice cream. I'll admit I got super lucky when I say I don't crave that food.

So I decided to sit down at the inevitable Starbucks beside the grocery store. I connected to Wifi briefly, and the LAN they had redirected me to a login page. The Firefox certificate viewer, shown below, shows that the WLAN was provided by Aruba Networks, a HP WLAN seller. I only managed to get that far before the boys came out with a scent of grease that clogged the air.

Disciplined recon seems important, so I went back home and hit up DuckDuckGo to search for "aruba networks vulnerabilities". Aruba has compiled their [security advisories][aruba] on their website. [This][presentation] presentation gave me a lot of things to research. I looked into [wardriving][wardriving]. After a while, I got bored though. Enjoying the ride seems important too, so I shut the computer and hung out with my friends.
