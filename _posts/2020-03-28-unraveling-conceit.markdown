Conceit in Buddhism takes on a broader meaning than being stuck up or boastful. Instead, conceit refers to the conception of other people as being wholly contained within their inherent existence. If you don't have a firm belief in the emptiness of your own self, it will be harder to see the emptiness in others so this may be a concept to explore later down the path. It's still worth skimming and filing away for when that time comes. 

According to Pali canon, conceit is the last defilement to fall away before enlightenment. It is the eighth of the ten fetters, and is powerfully freeing. Most sensations, positive or negative, need some degree of concentration to be based on. By seeing the base, these sensations, emotions, or judgements quickly subside. Without a belief in their inherent existence (existing without being based on something), they have significantly less power over our minds and actions. This holds true for reactions to others as well. 

This may be easier to grasp with an example. My friend said something I took offense to, and I felt the heat of my anger flash. I meditated on those heated moments. I realized I was angry he would imply I am unskilled, although he clearly stated he thought I was skilled.

I knew who I was angry with, but I wondered what I was angry with in that person. I was angry with his thoughts, but I wasn't angry with his perception or his physical body. I still valued those as parts of my dear friend. Further, who was angry? Me? Which parts of me? Seeing it clearly as my mind taking offense on behalf of myself, it became apparent this was a delusion. The self is so quick to defend it's coherence. Seeing others for the parts they are creates more room in our minds for love.

Conceit is often regarded as seeing things as superior, inferior, or equal. How can things be greater than or less then without regard to some quantity or quality? Quality is often apparent to be empty. "Hes full of shit", "I think she's hot", "that jackass", etc are all extremely relative judgements. To understand how quantity is empty, dont all individuals have parts? Do you count the parts too? How many parts is that? Are those parts also countable?

Do apple's think of oranges as having a core? How can things be equal without a comparer as well? One without delusion can help so much. Ultimate happiness is in other beings' happiness. One without delusion, aggression, or greed can bring such happiness to others. This is why we practice. Use today to make your tomorrows better. Use tomorrow to make other's todays better.
