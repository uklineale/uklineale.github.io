I don't intend to offend anyone with this post. I seek to unify seemingly disparate philosophies because at the end of the day we're all on this Earth together. I believe Abrahamic religions and Buddhism are two superficially different approaches to the same truth. Although I mostly speak of Christianity and Buddhism, I assume other religions fit this pattern as well. I'm only familiar with these two, so I can only speak to these two. After witnessing the similarities of God and emptiness, I believe these two words belie the same truth. Similarly, I believe heaven and nirvana are synonymous. It's been said one of the main problems of philosophy is most debates boil down to a disagreement in terminology. 

To illustrate the coin these two approaches illuminate, I'll use Rob Burbea's [_Seeing That Frees_](https://www.amazon.com/Seeing-That-Frees-Robert-Burbea/dp/0992848911). I discovered Rob Burbea's work in the FAQ of [r/streamentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/streamentry/). Unfortunately, Rob passed away recently after a long struggle with cancer. His work has been so comprehensive, detailed, and straight forward helping many souls reach salvation. Rob has been a real gem of a person, and his life will echo on long past his death. 

A good friend gave me Thomas Merton's [_New Seeds of Contemplation_](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1133302-new-seeds-of-contemplation). _New Seeds_ is a phenomenal bundle of notes from a Christian monk named Thomas Merton. He organized his notes during his years of contemplation (or meditation), with many, many wisdoms on the fundamental nature of God. In some versions, he prefaces his book by saying how he is merely one of many Christian scholars, monks, and explorers realizing the glory of emptiness and God's plan.

Shaving away at either nothing or everything - both words fall short 

God and emptiness

Heavan and Nirvana
- ["The obvious question that most people have at this point is: what is it like? After all, it’s Nirvana – which is synonymous with “heaven” in the minds of many. There are a lot of confused ideas about what it is (or isn’t). My recommendation is to expect nothing – literally."](https://alohadharma.com/2011/06/29/cessation/)
